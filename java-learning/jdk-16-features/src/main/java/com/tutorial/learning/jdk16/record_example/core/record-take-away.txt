1. Default Block or Instance initializers are not allowed in records

For Example:
public record RecordHelloWorld(String text) {
	{
		text = "Hello World";
	}
}
	
2. Records cannot extend any class

3. Records cannot be abstract; they are implicitly final

4. The components of a record are implicitly final

5. Records cannot declare instance fields 
(other than the private final fields that correspond to the components of the record component list); 
any other declared fields must be static

For Example:
public record RecordHelloWorld() {
	
	static final String HELLO = "Hello";
	
	static String WORLD = "World";
}
